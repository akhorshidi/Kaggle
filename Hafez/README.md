# حافظ‌‌ پژوهی رایانه‌ای
## Mining The Poetry of Hafiz

The aim of this project is to provide a CLI-based text mining tool-chain (Bash, Bicon, GNUPlot, AWK, SED, and UNIX Filters) to study and analysis Huge Persian text files.

You need the Bicon [1] to create a Persian supporting subshell. To verify that Bicon has been installed, first do:
```sh
./init.sh
```
After that, run the script hafez.sh and see the results:
```sh
./hafez.sh
```
Lastly, it runs "gnuplot plot.in" to plots some of the outputs.

This project takes its inspiration and data from the book **Practical Data Science** [2].
